## Why object oriented programming came?
There were different era of programming
The first programming was linear programming means your code will be line by line
Forexample: if you want to write "Wania Kazmi" thousand times then you have to print it thousand times

Then era change and structural programming came, procedural programming or control programming and we get control of if-else, for loop, try-catch control. These control gives you power that you can do structural programming. Forexample: now you can print 100 line of "Wania Kazmi" using for loop

Still there was a problem in code updation so here OOP came up
